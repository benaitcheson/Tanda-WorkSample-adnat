# README



I have set this repo up to do the Tanda adnat (backend) challenge. Once I've done more Ruby on Rails for this I will do another challenge, the Tanda adnat (react).

Instead of making two projects that interface via API I wanted to learn about webpack runs and have both these projects in a single repo compiled and run from the same server.

For anyone starting out. I would highly recommend doing these two challenges.
